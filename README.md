# Introduction

## Purpose
Draw attention from future college students into STEAM careers through a simple videogame.

## Scope
A 2D videogame puzzle/exploration oriented powered by Unity due to its adaptability and intuitivity of use for projects of this sort. Another important tool to be used is WebGl for connecting the JS script into the 2D graphics and mechanics of the game. 
Describe the software being specified. Include benefits, objectives, and goals. This should relate to overall business goals, especially if teams outside of development will have access to the SRS

## Definitions and Acronyms
- STEAM: Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics
- GPU: graphics processor unit
- JS: JavaScript
- 2D: Two dimensions 
- WebGL: Web Graphics Library

Include any non-trivial definition or acronym used in the document.

# Overall Description
The game consists in a 2D cenital perspective exploarion and puzzle centered experience. It's a brand new delivery that's based on existing videogames with similar concepts.
The player will take the role of a character inside a PC build whose main objective is exploring and realizing the tasks of each of the computer components. The tasks to be made in each components will be in a puzzle nature, resembling in a way the actual function of these components.

## User classes
- Player: the target audience are college newcomers in whom we intend to delevope an interest for the careers STEAM has to offer through the gaming experience. 
- STEAM: with the information provided by the players, the organization will create an objective analysis about their particular interests while playing the game. 

## Assumptions and Dependencies

There might be factors that impact your ability to fulfill the requirements outlined in this document. What are those factors?

Are there any assumptions you’re making that could turn out to be false? You should include those here, as well.

Finally, you should note if your project is dependent on any external factors. This might include software components you’re reusing from another project.

# System Features and Requirements
This is where you detail the specific requirements for building your product.

## Functional Requirements
The functional requirements describe the services and functions of a system. Functional requirements must be precise and unambiguous.

Include user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature, told from the perspective of one of your end user profiles. They are typically structured in the following fashion:

> As a __[type of user]__, I want __[some goal]__ so that __[some reason]__.

You may want to use the following template table.

|Title|User story|Importance|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|_Short identifier_|_As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]_|_Must have_|_Write here any additional consideration_|

## External Interface Requirements
External interface requirements are types of functional requirements. They outline how your product will interface with other components or systems.

There are several types of interfaces you may have requirements for, including:
- User
- Hardware
- Software
- Communications

## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are restrictions on the system or the development process. Non-functional requirements can be more critical than functional ones. If they are not met, the system is useless!

# Screens
Identifying the individual screens (for an app), or pages (for a website) are where a product’s shape starts to become clear. They are a distillation of the user stories into a set of distinct sections that satisfy the needs and behaviors identified so far. The process of outlining an application’s screens may also highlight any requirements or considerations that have been overlooked up to this point.

This has the dual purpose of both contributing to a more accurate vision of the product early on, and serving as a jumping-off point for the time when designers do get involved.

## Wireframes
Wireframes are simple page layouts that outline the size and placement of elements, and features on a page. They are generally devoid of color, font styles, logos or any design elements.

Wireframing is probably the most time-consuming step of this process and for some simple projects, it may be overkill. For complex projects where serious design thinking needs to happen, wireframes are an indispensable tool.
